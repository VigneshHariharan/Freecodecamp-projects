 <p>This Ecma Standard is based on several originating technologies, the most well known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript
(Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that company’s Navigator 2.0 browser.
It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer
3.0. The development of this Standard started in November 1996. </p>
<p>The first edition of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the
Ecma General Assembly of June 1997. That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure,
and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved the
second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition
are editorial in nature.</p>

    <p>This Standard defines the ECMAScript scripting language.</p>
<p>
 A conforming implementation of ECMAScript must provide and support all the types, values, objects, properties, functions,
and program syntax and semantics described in this specification.</p>
<p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript is permitted to provide additional types, values, objects, properties, and functions
beyond those described in this specification. In particular, a conforming implementation of ECMAScript is permitted to provide
properties not described in this specification, and values for those properties, for objects that are described in this specification.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="web_scripting">
<header><h1>Web Scripting :</h1></header>
<p>A web browser provides an ECMAScript host environment for client-side computation including, for instance, objects that represent
    windows, menus, pop-ups, dialog boxes, text areas, anchors, frames, history, cookies, and input/output.</p>
<p>Further, the host environment provides a means to attach scripting code to events such as change of focus, page and image
    loading, unloading, error and abort, selection, form submission, and mouse actions. </p>
<p>Scripting code appears within the HTML and the displayed page is a combination of user interface elements and fixed and computed
    text and images. The scripting code is reactive to user interaction and there is no need for a main program.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="identifier_names_and_identifiers">
<header><h1>Identifier Names and Identifiers :</h1></header>
<p>Identifier Names are tokens that are interpreted according to the grammar given in the “Identifiers” section of chapter 5
    of the Unicode standard, with some small modifications</p>
<p>An Identifier is an IdentifierName that is not a ReservedWord (see 7.6.1). The Unicode identifier grammar is based on both
    normative and informative character categories specified by the Unicode Standard. </p>
<p>This standard specifies specific character additions: The dollar sign ($) and the underscore (_) are permitted anywhere in
    an IdentifierName.</p>
